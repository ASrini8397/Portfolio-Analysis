# Portfolio and Equity Analysis
Using Python to find Optimal Portfolios along an efficient frontier, generated through a Monte Carlo Simulation

The dotted line marks the Efficient Frontier and the portfolios that are represented by each bullet (Markowitz Bullets) were generated using a
Monte Carlo simulation. A total of 5000 portfolios were generated, each with a unique combination of holdings and portfolio volatility. The portfolio 
volatility has been calculated for each bullet as well.
